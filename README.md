# fcc-tictactoe

By: Baskoro Indrayana

## Description

This is a Tic-Tac-Toe project from FreeCodeCamp's Advanced Front-end Development Projects.

## Todo

**EDIT:** The minimax algorithm has been added. But when I'll reorganize my projects, I will try to increase its difficulty.
~~I'm adding the minimax algortihm for the opponent to assign the most strategic cell in the board.~~

In the near future, after I'll complete all of the remaining courses in FreeCodeCamp, 

- I plan to modify all of these FCC projects (some may remain in vanilla JS, some may be rewritten in Angular 2 / React) and push each of them in GitHub.

- I also plan to host these projects in a GitHub page I'll make, after I gain enough knowledge and projects.
